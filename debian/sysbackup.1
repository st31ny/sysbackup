.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IP
Execute pre\-backup scripts and transfer all specified files via rsync.
.SH OPTIONS:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR,\fB\-\-help\fR
Print this help and exit
.TP
.BR \-c\fR,\fB\-\-config=\fIfile\fR
Use \fIfile\fR as config file instead of the default
(\fI$SYSBACKUP_ROOT/etc/sysbackup/backup.conf\fR)
.TP
\fB\-d\fR,\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
Dry run. Don't actually do anything, just show what
would happen.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR,\fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose.
.SH FILES:
.SS \fI/etc/sysbackup/backup.conf\fR
Main configuration file. See there for inline documentation.
Make sure to uncomment the line \fBBACKUP=true\fR, otherwise \fBsysbackup\fR will just do nothing.
.SS \fI/etc/sysbackup/sources/*.list\fR
Place all source directories in these files, one at a line.
Empty lines and lines starting with \fB#\fR are ignored.
Optionally, a line can be preceded by \fBName=\fR to explicitly define a name of a source.
If unset, names are generated by replacing all \fB/\fR by \fB_\fR.
All specified source files and directories are transfered using rsync upon invocation of \fBsysbackup\fR.
.SS \fI/etc/sysbackup/scripts/*\fR
Executable files in this directory are run prior to transfering files.
The working directory for a \fBprogram\fR is set to \fIpath/to/base/wd/\fBprogram\fR, where \fIpath/to/base/wd/\fR defaults to \fI/var/lib/sysbackup/scripts/\fR, but can be altered in the main configuration file.
The standard ouput of the programs is redirected to a file \fIstdout\fR in the working directory.
In that it is particularily easy to backup data written to stdout.
Non-existent working directories are created.
No files are purged after the backup has finished.
