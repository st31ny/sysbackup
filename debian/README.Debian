sysbackup for Debian
-------------------

A systemd service service and timer have been added to the package. The timer
schedules the service daily at 5:43 in the morning. The service unit stays
active until the backup is complete.

By default, sysbackup is run as user "sysbackup". In order to run it as root,
use `systemctl edit sysbackup.service` and change the stanza appropriately.
