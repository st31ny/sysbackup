Description: rsync wrapper for easy setup of remote backup scenarios
 Sysbackup is a bash script that simply reads source directories from files in
 the configuration directory. Each source directory is then transfered to a
 target address using rsync.
 The source file definitions can be split up into many files (just like
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/), so automated setup routines can easily configure
 their data directories that need to be backed up.
 Before actually transfering data, optional scripts can be executed to generate
 the data that is to be backed up.
 Two helper scripts generate and show the ssh key of the sysbackup user for easy
 setup of remote ssh servers.
